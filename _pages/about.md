Hi! I am a third-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at <a href='https://www.ucas.acacns'>UCAS</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://ofey.me/'>Prof. Fei Sun</a>.

During my second year, I participated in the <a href='https://ysyx.oscc.cc/'>ysyx project</a> to explore my interests in computer architecture. This experience helped me realize that this field was not the right fit for me.
Currently, I am a research beginner in the NLP field, advised by <a href='https://ofey.me/'>Prof. Fei Sun</a>, focusing on exploring hallucinations, memory, and knowledge mechanisms in LLMs.
Looking ahead, I plan to further explore the MLSys and HPC domains before settling on a specific research area to specialize in.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about classical music, 3D modeling, and exploring new tools and applications on Linux/GitHub.
